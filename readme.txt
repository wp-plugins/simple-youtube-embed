Embed YouTube videos beautifully in WordPress

== Description ==

Simple YouTube Embed plugin is the easiest way to embed YouTube videos in WordPress. This plugin extends the default YouTube embed with advanced player parameters. When the page is rendered, a high resolution thumbnail image is displayed instead of the YouTube video player.

= Features =

* Pretty YouTube video embed
* Responsive and mobile friendly
* Embed a YouTube video with a high definition thumbnail image as the poster
* Enable/Disable display of suggested videos when the video finishes
* Enable/Disable player controls

= Simple YouTube Embed Usage =

Create a new post/page and enter your YouTube video URL to embed it. Make sure the URL is on its own line and not hyperlinked (clickable when viewing the post). In order to avoid formatting errors, It's better to place the URL into the content area in text mode. For example:

`http&#58;//www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpg9yizPP_g`

*Related videos*

In order to disable related videos from showing you can add "rel=0" to a YouTube URL.

`http&#58;//www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpg9yizPP_g&rel=0`

*Controls*

If you do not want to show player controls you can add "controls=0" to a YouTube URL.

`http&#58;//www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpg9yizPP_g&controls=0`
